# Assembler?

A tool to transform a very basic assembly language into instruction code (to be used with logisim). Created for college and for fun.

Usage:

``` sh
clojure -M -m revoir.cli -i "your-input-file-path" -o "output-file-name"
# or
./compile.sh "your-input-file-path" "output-file-name"
```
