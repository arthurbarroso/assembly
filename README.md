# Assembler?

A tool to transform a very basic assembly language into instruction code (to be used with logisim). Created for college and for fun.

Usage:

``` sh
java -jar releases/revoir-0.0.1.jar -i "input-file" -o "output-file"
# or
clojure -M -m revoir.cli -i "your-input-file" -o "output-file"
# or
./compile.sh "your-input-file" "output-file"
```
